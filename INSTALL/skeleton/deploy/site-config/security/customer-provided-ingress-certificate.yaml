## Example SecretGenerator to generate the secret to be used by the ingress controller
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ INGRESS_CERTIFICATE_FILE_NAME }}"
## should be replaced by the path to a .pem file containing your ingress certificate.
## If you use the suggested example directory structure, the correct, final syntax would resemble the following:
## - tls.crt=site-config/security/sas-ingress-certificate.pem
## - tls.key=site-config/security/sas-ingress.key
## - ca.crt=site-config/security/sas-ingress-CA-certificate.pem
##
##  Special Note:  the name of the Kubernetes secret which will contain the certificate and key can be
##  renamed.  However, the name provided below "sas-ingress-certificate" is referenced in other kustomization
##  files.  If you change the name below, you will need to change all the other references: All the ingress objects' spec.tls.secretName
##  and the sas-certframe-ingress-certificate-config config map's SAS_INGRESS_CERTIFICATE_SECRET_NAME environment variable.
##  Use the sas-bases/overlays/network/ingress/security/transformers/ingress-tls-transformers.yaml as guidance.

## This file specifies the certificate and key to be used by the Ingress controller.
## The files named below must exist in a directory under your kustomization.yaml prior to running the 'kustomize build' command, and
## they must be readable by the user ID that is running the kustomize command.
## The tls.crt certificate file contains the server identity certificate plus all intermediate CA certificates in the chain between it
## and the root CA certificate. Certificates are ordered according to issuer hierarchy. The hierarchy starts with the server identity
## certificate, which is followed by its issuer, then followed by its issuer and so on, up to and including the root CA certificate.
## SAS recommends including the root CA certificate as the last certificate in the tls.crt file.  While not strictly required, this makes it
## more convenient for clients to obtain the root CA certificate.
## The ca.crt certificate file contains the root CA certificate that is the issuer of the ingress server identity certificate. SAS recommends
## redundantly including the root CA certificate in both the tls.crt file and the ca.crt file. Unless your ingress certificate was issued by
## one of the public CA certificates distributed by https://www.mozilla.org, then it must either be included in this file or via the mechanism
## documented in the security README.md section labeled "Incorporating Additional CA Certificates".
## The certificates and key will be copied into the Kubernetes secret named above.
## The files can be deleted after you run the 'kustomize build' command with the modified kustomization files in place.
